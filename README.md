# Course-Management-system!

A course management system I made in collaboration with 2 other group members. <br />
Package includes some unit tests by the file names which have _test at the end of it. <br />

sms.py -- Front-end, includes a Stack implementation which we created <br />
student.py -- Back-end, includes all methods and Classes used in sms.py. <br />

---------
When on sms.py, one can execute the following commands:

exit -- exit the program, i.e. break the loop <br />
undo -- undo the previous command <br />
undo <n> -- undo n number of commands <br />
common-courses <name1> <name2> -- print common courses within two students <br />
list-courses <name1> -- lists all courses name1 is enrolled in <br />
drop <name> <course> -- drops name from course <br />
enrol <name> <course> -- enrolls name into course <br />
create student <name> -- creates a student object with name attribute to name <br />
<br /><br />
Have fun y'all! :)
